# 🕵️‍♂️ Case 2026: The Mystery of the Impossible Variant

## Scene Setting

Dr. Mendelian, a famous geneticist, has stumbled upon an unexpected puzzle while investigating the Ashkenazi trio. During the analysis of their genomes, he discovered a variant that appears only in the son—but **not** in either parent. 

> **Is this evidence of...**
> - A sequencing error?
> - A _de novo_ mutation?
> - Something more mysterious?
> - Perhaps a sample mix-up in the lab?

## 🕵️‍♂️ YOUR MISSION

You must find the mysterious variant(s) and decide: Are these true biological events or technical artifacts?

## 🔬 PART 1: THE HUNT BEGINS

**Step 1:**  
Set up your detective tools. Make a new folder named `CASE_2026` and copy the combined VCF file you created earlier into it.

**Step 2:**  
Hunt for suspicious mutations:
- Identify variants present in the son (HG002) but absent in both parents (HG003, HG004).

**Step 3:**  
Visualize the suspects:
- Use your bioinformatics tools to count how many such suspicious variants exist.

## 🧪 PART 2: THE FORENSIC ANALYSIS

*The plot thickens: is this truly an error, or something more?*

**Step 4:** 
Remove suspects with good alibis:
Filter with criteria to keep only high-confidence, "impossible" variants:

```
FORMAT/DP[0]>=15 && FORMAT/DP[1]>=15 && FORMAT/DP[2]>=15 &&
FORMAT/GQ[0]>=30 && FORMAT/GQ[1]>=30 && FORMAT/GQ[2]>=30
```

- DP: Read Depth; GQ: Genotype Quality
- Apply to all trio members—this ensures strong evidence.

**The Deep Dive: Look at read-level evidence**  
After filtering, check how many variants remain.

```bash
bcftools query -f '%CHROM\t%POS\t%REF\t%ALT[\t%SAMPLE=%GT:%AD:%DP:%GQ]\n' \
  impossible.dp15.gq30.vcf.gz > impossible.casefile.tsv
```

## 🔍 PART 3: THE BIG REVEAL

Examine your final list of suspects. Which are truly _de novo_ mutations? Which are just technical ghosts? Give an explanation for each.

### Possible Outcomes

#### **1) Sequencing/Calling Error (most common)**
- **Typical Evidence:**
  - Child is 0/1 but allele balance is strange (e.g., AD = 30,2)
  - One or both parents show some alternate reads (despite 0/0 genotype, e.g., AD = 40,1 or 35,2)
  - Variant is a messy indel

#### **2) De Novo Mutation (the “real” impossible variant)**
- **Strong De Novo Candidate:**
  - Child is 0/1 **with balanced AD** (about 40–60% ALT, e.g., AD = 24,28)
  - Both parents are 0/0 with **no ALT reads** at all (e.g., AD = 38,0 and 41,0)
  - All DP and GQ are high (as enforced by your filter)

## 📝 FINAL REPORT

For each remaining variant, decide:

- **Is it a likely sequencing/calling error, or a real de novo mutation?**
  - Justify your conclusion based on read counts, genotype quality, and parental evidence.

Good luck, Detective! The truth is in the data.
